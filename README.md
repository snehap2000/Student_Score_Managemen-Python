## Final Conclusion


The Student Score Management System project successfully demonstrates how to manage, analyze, and visualize student performance data using Python. By allowing educators to input scores, calculate statistics, and visualize the data with graphs, it provides a simple yet powerful tool for monitoring and understanding student progress. The project is easily extensible, offering room for future enhancements such as exporting data or adding more complex statistical features. Overall, it serves as a practical and flexible solution for managing student scores and can be adapted to suit a wide range of educational needs.
we have concluded that there is no/negligible impact on the student's score due to their parent's marital Status. also, we have concluded that the education of the parents have a good impact Scores.Â¶
